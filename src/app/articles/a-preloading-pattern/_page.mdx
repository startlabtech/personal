I have recently fallen in love with Next.js due to how easy it is to build
a performant react applications. The biggest feature that enables this is
[Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)
and how you can [preload your data](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#preloading-data) at the top of the React tree but not block the rendering of components that dont require that data.

If we look at a typical rendering / request cycle of a React component that requires some data from an extenral source it might look like the following.

We would define an Item component that would make a request

<div className="code-block">
  ```tsx:app/item/[id]/page.tsx 
  
  interface ItemProps {
    id: string
  }

export const Item = ({id}: ItemProps) => {
  const [item, setItem] = useState(undefined)

useEffect(() => {
setItem(item)
})

return <p>{item.name}</p>
}

```
</div>
```
